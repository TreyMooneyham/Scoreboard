# Scoreboard
## ImGui
I haven't gotten these linked properly because I don't know how to do it without breaking things.
Using Ocornut's ImGui version 1.90.2 because it's my favorite :)

## JSON
Using the JSON library by nlohmann because it looks nice.

## Character Sheet
Objective here is to make something akin to D&DBeyond but for my TTRPG.

### Goals
1. Make an active character sheet.
2. Make it manage all character features.
3. Make it manage inventory.
4. Make it not ugly as fuck.
5. Physical dice rolling? Terrible idea. Probably just an RNG spinner with a timer to make it look like something is happening.
